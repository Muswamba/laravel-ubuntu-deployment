Pre-deploy checklist

Server and OS:
- Confirm Ubuntu version: 22.04 LTS or 24.04 LTS
- `sudo apt update && sudo apt -y upgrade`
- Confirm disk and memory are sufficient: `df -h`, `free -h`

Access and security:
- SSH key login works for deploy user
- UFW is enabled for `22`, `80`, `443`
- `fail2ban` active: `sudo systemctl status fail2ban --no-pager`

Runtime:
- `php8.4-fpm`, `mysql`, `nginx`, `supervisor` installed
- Node and npm versions verified
- Composer installed

Project config:
- Correct domain/subdomains (`web`, `api`, `ws`) in DNS
- `.env` exists with production values (no debug)
- Queue, cache, session, and mail drivers configured
- Reverb env values set if real-time features are enabled

Nginx and TLS:
- Site configs present in `/etc/nginx/sites-available`
- Symlinks exist in `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled`
- `sudo nginx -t` passes
- Certbot certificates ready or DNS propagated for issuance

Application readiness:
- Laravel dependencies installed (`composer install --no-dev`)
- Frontend dependencies installed and app built
- Storage and cache permissions fixed
- Migrations reviewed and backup plan prepared

Database safety:
- Current backup taken before migration/import
- Credentials are not committed in repository files
